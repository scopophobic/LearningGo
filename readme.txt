
want to learn :
- goLang
- devops - mainly on how ot deploy secure and smoothly and everything in between
- and also wanna get a little into cloud n all


right now : 

doing goLang
started with a good structure of learning, but lost interest for this tight and rigid way of learning. now focusing more on project based learning.
will build random shit here and try to learn. before that ofc i will get all the basics done.
