## All the good resource found in my journey of learning GoLang :

- [Tour of Go ](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)- good site for practice and basics
- [Go Online Editor](https://go.dev/play/)- play around with go code.
- [Go Offical Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)- is considered good and only resource you might need to learn the basics and further.



## Books :
- Letâ€™s Go by Alex Edwards
- Advanced go API patterns ~ alex edward
