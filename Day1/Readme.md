# Day one - Learning GO

- [X] Install Go & set up workspace (GOPATH, GOROOT)  
- [X] Write your first Go program (Hello, World!)  
- [ ] Learn variables, constants, data types, operators  
- [ ] Practice control structures (if, switch, loops)  
- [ ] Hands-on: Write a simple calculator CLI  


### Key Point Learned : 
- in Go, program starts with `package main`.
- you can't import a libary if not use, it will throw error, so basically you can't have all the libaries loaded just in case.
- `func main()` this is the main function, where you code the main thing.
